# Dynamic DOM Viewer
A handy Javascript development tool.

I created this tool way back around 2003, before there was Firebug, before there were DOM inspectors and developer tools built into web browsers.

Originally I created this tool to make it easy to peer into the HTML DOM of any web browser that will run Javascript. It is not built for any particular browser. It is simply HTML and Javascript.

Recently I added a major enhancement which allows the user to load an external Javascript library dynamically, and then peer into the properties, objects, and functions within that library.
